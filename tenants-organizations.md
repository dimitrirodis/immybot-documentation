# Tenants

## Tenant List
All columns have a search and filter function, as well as the ability to sort said columns. You can also create new tenants manually here, and run batch actions against a selection of tenants.

- New tenants can be created manually, however we do recommend you manage tenant creation through an integration. Please see
[Tenant Management](./tenant-management.md)

- Bulk actions allow you to make mass changes to tenant preferences to streamline your tenant managment where necessary.

When you click into a tenant you will see any tags associated with the tenant at the top, and a list of tabs that pertain to the contents of the tenant or the preferences you've set for the tenant. From this page you can:
- Manage computers individually and en masse
