We did not use serialnumber because we learned that many computers do not have serial numbers.</p><p>In practice, this value works almost <em>too</em> well. Machines you just wiped and expect to find in New Computers, are often associated to their pre-wiped computer objects. To find them, you often have to search for the serial number of the computer in the Computer List. In 0.40.1 we began using the Windows OfflineInstallationID value to identify when an existing computer has been wiped so we can set its status to &quot;Needs Onboarding&quot; which causes it to show up under New Computers as expected.</p><p>If it is a machine ImmyBot has seen before, it will be associated to the existing Computer, and you will find a new entry under the Computer&#39;s Agents tab.
