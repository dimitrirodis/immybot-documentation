## Users
People are synced from Entra to facilitate [User Affinity](./user-affinity.md). You can also create Users from people when they need access to ImmyBot. People who are part of a subtenant can be added as a User to have access to their ImmyBot Tenant. See [User Managment](./add-users.md) for instructions on adding and managing Users.
