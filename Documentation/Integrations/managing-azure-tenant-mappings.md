# Managing Azure Tenant Mapping

## Overview
This document will go over management of Azure tenants to your ImmyBot tenants.

## Prerequisites
An active ImmyBot subscription or [trial](https://www.immy.bot/pricing/)

You need to be an MSP Admin

You need to have an Azure Partner tenant linked to a tenant in your instance

## Navigation
**Show More** > **Azure**

## Process
1. Select the parent tenant from the drop down
2. You will be presented with information on the parent tenant.
   1. We recommend having the parent tenant have the Custom Azure permission level. See [this document](/Documentation/Integrations/azure-graph-permissions-setup)
3. Scroll down to "Azure Customer Mapper"
4. From here, you can link customers, import customers, etc.

### Link a single tenant
1. Find the tenant in the Azure Customer List
2. On the right hand side, under the Linked Tenant find the "Link" hyperlink and click on it.
3. From the drop down, select the tenant, or create a new tenant.

### Import tenants in mass
1. Click the checkbox to the left of the tenants you want to import
2. Click on "Import the # selected unassigned customers" where # is the number of customers you checked

Alteratively, you can click on "Import all Customer" to import them into you're instance.
