::: info  The API URL field is added to the individual user page once API keys have been generated for the user.

6. The API Key and the API Secret Key will be displayed. Make a note of these and the API URL somewhere safe.

::: danger  Important
The API Secret Key will be hidden for security reasons after navigating away from this page. It will not be possible to retrieve it again. However, you can regenerate API keys at any time by returning to the page and clicking Generate API Keys. This will invalidate any keys previously generated. Similarly, clicking Delete API Keys will revoke access altogether. Regenerating and deleting API keys is irreversible, and you must confirm the action by clicking **Confirm** in the confirmation dialog box.
