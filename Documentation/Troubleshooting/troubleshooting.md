This comprehensive guide will help you troubleshoot common issues with ImmyBot, including agent connectivity problems, identification failures, security software conflicts, and more. Follow the step-by-step instructions to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.

## Identification Failures

### Needs a Manual Decision

Generally you will click "Agent Re-installed"

Often when an RMM Agent gets re-installed, it will get a new id in the RMM (ComputerId in Automate, SessionID in Control). ImmyBot will recognize that it is the same computer, but due to the fact that virtualization technologies and hard drive cloning can lead to the same scenario, we require you to tell us whether we should overwrite the existing RmmComputer, or keep both. 99% of the time you will click "Overwrite Existing". If the machine was in fact cloned, you would click Keep Both, in which case Immy shims the duplicate UUID with its own to prevent collisions.

## Pending Computers

Computers in the pending status have yet to be identified.

Computers may get stuck here if we are unable to run our Ephemeral Agent

```

Top 3 reasons for Identification Failures

1. SSL Inspection blocking our websocket
1. Security Software blocking PowerShell
1. Incorrect time is preventing SSL/TLS connection

To understand the various reasons identification can fail, it helps to understand how ImmyBot executions PowerShell

1. RMM or ImmyAgent runs Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe
1. Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe establishes a secure websocket to wss://subdomain.immy.bot and runs Invoke-PSPipeHost.ps1
1. Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe feeds Invoke-PSPipeHost.ps1 PowerShell over a pipe from the websocket session

```mermaid

    ImmyBot --> |Parallel|Automate[Run script to download and run Ephemeral Agent via Automate]
    ImmyBot --> |Parallel|Control[Run script to download and run Ephemeral Agent via Control]
    ImmyBot --> |Parallel|ImmyAgent[Run script to download and run Ephemeral Agent via ImmyAgent]
    ImmyBot --> |Parallel|N-Central[Run script to download and run Ephemeral Agent via N-Central]
    Automate --> Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe
    Control --> Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe
    ImmyAgent --> Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe
    N-Central --> Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe
    Immybot.Agent.Ephemeral.exe --> cmd.exe --> powershell.exe --> Invoke-PSPipeHost.ps1
```

The most common cause of identification failure is security software.

To know if this is the case, pull the logs from C:\ProgramData\ImmyBot\Logs and C:\ProgramData\ImmyBot\Scripts\*\*.logs

Normal Immybot Agent logs look like this:

DNS Filtering/Issues make the logs look like this

```
2022-09-20 20:39:59.712 +10:00 [INF] RESPONSE: {
  "Resource": "installer/challenge/request",
  "Method": "POST",
  "StatusCode": 0,
  "ErrorException": {
    "ClassName": "System.Net.WebException",
    "Message": "No such host is known. (XXXX.immy.bot:443)"
```

To correct it, you need to exclude DNS filtering for your instances hostnames, which are found under
 Show more > integrations > Fetch IP Address and Hostnames

If Powershell is failing to start on the endpoint within 60 seconds a timeout will occur.

Here is a suggestion on a cause and possible fix for that one <https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/rx68fw/powershell_slow_to_open_long_load_timesfixed>


## Group Policy Objects

PowerShell execution policies set through Group Policy can affect ImmyBot's ability to run scripts. Ensure the following GPO settings are configured correctly:

**Required GPO Settings:**
- Computer Configuration | Policies | Administrative Templates | Windows Components | Windows PowerShell | Turn on Script Execution (Enabled)
- User Configuration | Policies | Administrative Templates | Windows Components | Windows PowerShell | Turn on Script Execution (Enabled)

These GPOs have been known to cause issues with running scripts if not properly configured. We recommend setting the execution policy to "RemoteSigned" or "Unrestricted" for ImmyBot to function properly.

   - A session link or number (if applicable)

## Gather an Endpoint Trace Log

Windows Performance Recorder can generate a detailed log of an endpoint's activity, which can be used to identify environmental causes for issues running the ImmyBot Agent.

> [!NOTE]
> These traces can be resource intensive and may require 2-4 GB available RAM, depending on how active an endpoint is and how long a trace is running.

**Steps to Collect a Trace:**

1. From an elevated CMD prompt, run:
```bat
wpr.exe -start CPU -start Minifilter -start FileIO -start Registry
```
2. Recreate the issue that you're experiencing.
3. Wait 3-5 minutes, depending on the available RAM, and run:
```bat
wpr.exe -stop "C:\PerfLogs\examplefilename.etl" -compress
```

If the `wpr -stop` command fails, try running without the "-compress" parameter.

This ETL file can be reviewed in Windows Performance Analyzer from the Windows Performance Toolkit SDK.

## MDMDiagnostics Logs

For issues with device enrollment, MDMDiagnostics logs can help identify the root cause.

**Steps to Collect MDM Diagnostics:**

1. From an elevated CMD Prompt, run:
```bat
MDMdiagnosticstool.exe -area "DeviceProvisioning;DeviceEnrollment" -cab "C:\Temp\MDMDiag_Log.cab"
```

2. The cab file may be too large to email, so you can create a cloud share and send the link to `support@immy.bot`.
